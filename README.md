# Serendipity Storage

This is a coming-soon site for Serendipity Storage, a storage cabinet supplying business. 

[Coming-soon Site](https://anevrensburg.github.io/serendipity-soon/)

I have designed and implemented this coming-soon site as well as the commercial website using Javascript, HTML, and CSS with Bootstrap. 

My approach avoids the use of website generators like WordPress and CMS platforms, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills effectively. These sites are reactive and present well on all mobile devices as well as full-sized computer screens.

**The complete website went live in February 2023 and is currently in use:**
